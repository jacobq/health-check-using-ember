# System Health Check App

This is a sample application that I'm developing primarily to help myself and others learn to use [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). It also uses [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and the [Ember Addon](http://emberaddons.com/) [Bootstrap for Ember](https://github.com/ember-addons/bootstrap-for-ember).
Feel free to improve it or at least share feedback. 

## Prerequisites:
* Install `node.js`
* Install `grunt`
* (optional) Install `node-webkit` and add `nw` to path

## Quick start
1. `npm install` (load dependencies)
2. `grunt` (run default task, which builds everything from scratch)
3.  Execute the binary in `dist/[your OS]` (or run `nw dist`)
